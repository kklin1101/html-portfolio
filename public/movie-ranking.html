<h1>The Best Movie According to Katie</h1>
<p><h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2></p>
<hr />
<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>It's a movie with so many layers, not just about cheesy romance but famliy relationships. </p>
<h3>Notting Hill</h3>
<p>It's a classic romance. Whenever I feel down or there's no hope in finding love, it's my go-to movie to cheer myself up.</p>
<h3>I Love You Man</h3>
<p>Funny, classic and maybe a bit cheesy, but still a good one to cheer you up when you just need a good laugh.</p>
